# Example: container/SSE roadmap sketch

Container and SSE transports are planned. Configure tools in `settings.mcp.toml` with `transport = "http"` or `transport = "container"` and point to community servers from the Awesome MCP catalog. Lifecycle manager and registry are transport-agnostic, so adding a new tool only requires configuration and optional entrypoint registration.
