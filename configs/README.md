# Configs

Configuration files for agents, tools, memory, and observability. These can be loaded directly or composed via Hydra/Dynaconf.

- `agent.demo.yaml` – demo profile for local runs.
- `memory.yaml` – vector backend choices and namespaces.
- `rag.yaml` – LlamaIndex settings and ingestion paths.
- `observability.yaml` – Langfuse/OpenInference toggles.
